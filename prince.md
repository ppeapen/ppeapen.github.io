# Blessings or Curses: You can Choose

Here's a quick overview of the topic so that you will be motivated to read the book *Blessings and Curses: You Can Choose* by **Derek Prince**. It's  a good book. This is *not* a summary of the book but a recollection of what I remember from my reading of the book in 1995. 

Blessings and curses are real. They are words spoken out or uttered under one's breath. They have the power to change the course of an individual, a clan, or a nation. A curse without any cause won't harm anyone. A blessing, on the other hand, will be a blessing even if the recipient is undeserving. 

## Examples of Blessing and Curses

**God blessed:**

- Adam and Eve 
- Noah
- Abraham and his descendants 
- Isaac
- Jacob
- All who would obey His Laws (Deut 28)
- David
- Solomon

**People who blessed others:**

- Noah blessed Shem and Japheth
- Isaac blessed Jacob
- Jacob blessed his sons and Joseph's sons
- The High Priest blessed Israelites 
- Boaz blessed his workers; they blessed him
- The elders blessed Boaz and Ruth
- Zechariah blessed his son John the Baptist
- Jesus blessed little children 

**Examples of Curses**

- God cursed the earth and the serpent
- Noah cursed his son Ham
- God cursed Lot's grandchildren Moab & Amnon
- Jacob cursed his sons Reuben and Levi
- Rebecca volunteered to take up Isaac's (silent) on his son Jacob for cheating him. Jacob got the blessings. The father's silent curse went to Rebecca. 
- Israel was cursed by their disloyalty to Gibeonites by King Saul
- The curse for disobeying the Law came upon Israel (Deut 29)
- Jesus cursed Jewish cities for rejecting Him
- Paul cursed anyone who corrupts the Gospel
- Paul cursed anyone who doesn't love the Lord. 

## Who should bless you?

- Parents and Grandparents 
- Teachers
- Pastors, Elders
- Employers/ Superiors
- Anyone in authority
- Folks with whom you do business or interact
- Those who have helped you (neighbours, sponsors, co-workers, supporters, etc) 

## Golden Rule

Always strive to get blessings from everyone. Never do anything that can cause people to harbour ill will. Even if they curse you in their hearts, it won't be good for you. 

## Are You Under A Curse?

### Common Signs of Curses

These are a few common systems of a person or a community or a nation is struggling under curses. 

- Mental illnesses, especially seen over several generations

- Unexplained and repeated accidents

- A history of suicides in the family

- Unexplained and repeated misfortunes

- A history of broken relationships, broken and dysfunctional families, divorces, etc., in your family or your spouse's family

- Inescapable cycles of poverty and failures

- Personal, family, or community ruin through substance abuse, addictions, immorality, etc.

- Repeated and unexplained failures in academics, business, career, agriculture, etc.

- Inescapable cycles of war, conflict, internal breakdown of peace, crime, etc. 


## Causes Behind Curses

### Questions for Self-examination:  

- Did you depart from God's counsel for your life? 

- Did you leave any school, college, or church, workplace, etc., without earning the goodwill or blessings of people who were in authority?

- Did you leave home or set out for something without your parents' blessings?

- Did you offend or hurt or sin against anyone? 

- Did you wilfully belittle someone in your pride?

- Did you return evil to those who did good to you?

- Did you cheat or act unfaithfully? Did you break your promises, thereby ruining someone's life?

- Have you, knowingly or unknowingly, benefitted from someone else's unjust loss? Were you given a job or promotion or an inheritance at someone else's expense? 

- Did you or your forebears ever oppress the poor or the downtrodden? Were they given loans at high interests? Were their property seized? Were they deprived of their livelihood unjustly?

- Did you (or your forebears) commit gross injustice against your siblings (or step-brothers/sisters) or against your children born in a second or subsequent marriage or against children born out of wedlock? Was any child unjustly thrown out or given off in adoption to "save family honor" or due to other factors?

- Did you (or your forebears) wilfully follow accursed sins that God hates—idolatry, rebellion, sorcery, perjury, immorality, human trafficking (indirect participation through porn etc), homosexuality, child abuse, violence or torture, abortion, murder, etc.?

- Did you curse yourself or your family in anger and frustration?

- Has your country's government — current or previous ones – been guilty of wars, conquest, slave trade, genocide, colonial oppression, human trafficking, human rights violations, etc., either at home or in other countries? Some of your sufferings may be due to God's curse or curses from those your country or people oppressed for many generations. 


## What about generational curses? 

- Is there a history of mental illnesses in your family over generations? 

- Or, a history of suicides, substance abuse, divorces, severe illnesses, accidents, debts, miscarriages, mental retardation, etc., in your family over generations? 

## Deliverance from curses

- Acknowledge each of your sins

- If applicable, acknowledge the grievous sins of your forefathers by which curses that might have passed on to you. Also, acknowledge the sins of your community, of governments that ruled your country. 

- Seek God's forgiveness for your sins

- Ask God to break all curses over you through Jesus' cross on which He became a curse for you so that you may partake of Abraham's blessings

- Confess God's Word that promises forgiveness of sins and blessings

- Thank God for His Word and His deliverance

- Start a life of obedience to God

- Be careful to earn people's goodwill and blessings

- Ignore curses that have no basis (when you haven't done anything wrong against the person cursing you)

- Do not curse anyone or yourself

- Release people from your curses; bless them; sincerely wish for their success.
